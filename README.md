# Point Cloud Registration with ICP and KD-Tree from Scratch

## 🔍 Overview
Implementing a high-performance point cloud registration pipeline using Python and NumPy.

## 🚀 Features
- Efficient k-nearest neighbor search using KD-Tree
- SVD-based ICP for rigid transformation
- Supports 600k+ points with optimized memory usage
- Trimmed ICP for robustness against noise and outliers

## 📈 Performance
| Method | Runtime | Speedup |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Naive nearest neighbor | 〇〇 s | 1x |
| KD-Tree accelerated ICP | 〇〇 s | ⭐~x faster |
